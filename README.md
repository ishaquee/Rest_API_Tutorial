# Rest API Automation Using Rest Assured

This project showcases the implementation of Rest API automation using Rest Assured, a powerful Java library for testing RESTful APIs. The goal of this project is to provide a practical demonstration of automating API testing tasks and ensuring the quality and reliability of software solutions.

## Key Features

- Set up test environments for API automation
- Write robust API tests using Rest Assured
- Validate API responses using advanced techniques
- Handle authentication and dynamic payloads
- Implement data-driven testing with different data sources
- Create and utilize mock APIs for comprehensive testing

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ishaquee/rest-api-automation.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `reload the pom.xml file`
3. Run the test suites: `mvn test`

## Examples

To demonstrate the usage of Rest Assured for API automation, this project includes examples of common API testing scenarios, such as:

- Sending GET requests and validating the response
- Performing POST requests with different payloads
- Verifying status codes and response headers
- Extracting and asserting on response data
- Handling authentication mechanisms like OAuth or JWT

Check the `src/test/java` directory for detailed code snippets and explanations.
